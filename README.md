# ConsoleGame
I have started this project with no clear goal in mind. I was mainly inspired by javidx9's ["Code-It-Yourself! First Person Shooter"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8skO7MFYw) tutorial and later by his ["Super Fast Ray Casting in Tiled Worlds using DDA"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbSee-XM7WA) tutorial and wanted to see if could make sense of it myself, hence this project.

## What's the goal?
No idea! I don't even know what kind of game it is going to be. So far I am only laying the foundation for any game in general, and adding useful features along the way, so think of this as some primitive engine (if you could call it that, i have no idea how game engines work) to build game on top of. If this repo ever starts evolving towards some specific game, i will if course update this. 

**The main directives** I would however like to stick to along the developement are following..
- Terminal as the graphical output.
  - That's what it's build for, and what I want it to remain as. It's not practical (at all), but it's a fun constraint and I want to see how far I could take this with.
- Other kinds of outputs besides visual are not out of the table and might be introduced later.
- Third party libraries may be utilized if necessary.
